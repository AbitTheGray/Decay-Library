# Frequently Asked Questions

## JSON

### Why is there no JSON conversion to/from MAP or RMF?

[MAP](docs/GoldSrc/MAP.md) is text-based format and can easily be read by humans (at least with format description opened) and [RMF](docs/GoldSrc/RMF.md) can be converted into MAP without loosing data / precision.
