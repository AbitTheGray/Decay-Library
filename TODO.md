# TODO List

- General
  - `R_ASSERT` / `D_ASSERT`
    -[ ] Look for places where `R_ASSERT` can simplify the code (instead of `if` + `throw`)
  -[ ] Verify all formats in Valve Hammer Editor
- BSP (v30)
  -[ ] Change `BspFile` constructor to accept `std::istream` instead of `std::filesystem::path`
    - Make sure every `in.seekg` will work correctly even if the provided input does not start at index `0`
- FGD
  -[ ] Test for `Fgd::FgdFile::Subtract(...)`
  -[ ] `Fgd::FgdFile::Add(...)`, `Fgd::FgdFile::Subtract(...)` and `Fgd::FgdFile::Include(...)` should look at base classes
    - Verify whenever it is needed
    - Maybe also `Fgd::FgdFile::ProcessIncludes(...)`
- MAP
  -[ ] Conversion of `Map::MapFile`'s brush into polygon-based (or triangulated) object (including texture coordinates).
  -[ ] Utility functions to simplify entity manipulation / polygon conversion
  -[ ] Document in [MAP.md](docs/GoldSrc/MAP.md) how to convert brush into polygons
  -[ ] Cleanup entity properties using [FGD file](docs/Source/FGD.md)
- WAD
  -[ ] Add function to parse Font Atlas from image
    - Use in `wad_add` command, `--font_atlas` option
- Commands
  -[ ] Move command `bsp_lightmap` into `bsp2obj`
  -[ ] Maybe change `wad_add` to have `--output` and use `--file` as read-only
    - Can also allow `--output` without specific path to use the one from `--file`
