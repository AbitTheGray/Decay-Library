# TODO List

- General
  -[ ] Add messages into `R_ASSERT` and `D_ASSERT`
  -[ ] Look for places where `R_ASSERT` can simplify the code (instead of `if` + `throw`)
  -[ ] Replace `R_ASSERT` by `D_ASSERT` where it is only for comfort and not really needed
  -[ ] Add utility function to implement TODOs for "order-independent comparison" for `std::map` (and equivalent)
- BSP
  -[ ] Fix JSON export (without nlohmann's JSON library) to correctly escape `\` (required for `"wad"`)
- FGD
  -[ ] Test for `Fgd::FgdFile::ProcessIncludes(...)`
  -[ ] Test for `Fgd::FgdFile::Subtract(...)`
  -[ ] `Fgd::FgdFile::Add(...)`, `Fgd::FgdFile::Subtract(...)` and `Fgd::FgdFile::Include(...)` should look at base classes
    - Verify whenever it is needed
    - Maybe also `Fgd::FgdFile::ProcessIncludes(...)`
- MAP
  -[ ] Conversion of `Map::MapFile`'s brush into polygon-based (or triangulated) object (including texture coordinates).
  -[ ] Utility functions to simplify entity manipulation / polygon conversion
  -[ ] Document in [MAP.md](docs/GoldSrc/MAP.md) how to convert brush into polygons
  -[ ] Cleanup entity properties using [FGD file](docs/Source/FGD.md)
  -[ ] Conversion between `Map::MapFile` and `Rmf::RmfFile` (both directions)
- Commands
  -[ ] WIP - Rework implementation
  -[ ] Add FGD commands
  -[ ] Add `map2rmf` and `rmf2map` commands
